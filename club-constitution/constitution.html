<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >Taking as point of departure the historic fact that the mathematicians, students and scientists of all the grades
and ages of the Peddie School, united in the Club of Mathematics headed by our honorable President Jiayu
&#8220;Jerry&#8221; Liu, by their struggle in the formation of the Club and Mathematical Revelation overthrew
the old class order based on ageism, sleep deprivation and the fear of a lower GPA and began to
build a society in which human intellect and man would be emancipated from exploitation and
arbitrariness, a society in which each student and all of them together would find conditions for free
and all-round development; bearing in mind that the development of the person&#8217;s intellectual
foundations and of mathematical-social relationships, and the further development of relations based on
self-studying and mathematical equality, have brought about substantial changes in scholarly and social
relations which call for corresponding changes in the Constitution of the Math Club of 2022, but
that in which the Constitution in individual spheres has not yet been changed by constitutional
amendments; wishing to consolidate and further develop the revolutionary achievements already
accomplished, to strengthen the right and responsibility of the Members of the Club for their own
development and for the development of the Peddie community as a mathematical whole, and to
ensure the further development of mathematical-democratic relations of the inherent interest in
mathematics on the road to the emancipation of thought and the creation of a mathematical society;
proceeding also from the need to strengthen the constitutional system on uniform foundations of
mathematical acquisition of knowledge by the new Constitution of the Club of Mathematics, which, in
addition to the changes it introduces, incorporates and adjusts to it the provisions of the 2022
Constitution of the Club of Mathematics. The Officers, in agreement with the Students and Faculty
of the Department of Mathematics, have adopted <span

<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >Our core mission is to propagate the passion for mathematics to everyone at Peddie. Regardless of their
mathematical prowess, everyone can participate and engage in establishing an inclusive community of thinkers.
We will create a comfortable space for avid mathematicians to express their passion that will emanate to other
students at Peddie. We will offer opportunities to Peddie Students in a broader scope not restricted to the
classroom and the traditional math curriculum, paving the way to develop intellectual talents capable of
altering the globe.
