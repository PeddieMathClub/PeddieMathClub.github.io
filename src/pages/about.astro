  	<h3>
		Mission
	</h3>

	<p>
		Our core mission is to propagate the passion for mathematics to everyone at Peddie. Regardless of their
		mathematical prowess, everyone can participate and engage in establishing an inclusive community of
		thinkers. We will create a comfortable space for avid mathematicians to express their passion that
		will emanate to other students at Peddie. We will offer opportunities to Peddie Students in a broader
		scope not restricted to the classroom and the traditional math curriculum, paving the way to develop
		intellectual talents capable of altering the globe.
