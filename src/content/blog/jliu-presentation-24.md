Jerry Liu will present his research on the field of topological data analysis, more specifically the application of tools in algebraic topology to the rapidly growing field of data science. His project involves extensive programming in python to implement the powerful weapon of persistent homology to analyze high dimensional sporadic data pertaining to protein structure and genomes to reveal more insight in the field of biology. 

He will share his formal mathematic paper regarding the project and also complete a short and concise presentation available to everyone at Peddie School. The same presentation will be shared to the Peddie Math Faculties for his participation in Math EXP.
