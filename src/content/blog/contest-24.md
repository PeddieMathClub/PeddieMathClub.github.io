We organize the [Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge (COMC)](https://cms.math.ca/competitions/comc/comc2024/) and the [American Mathematics Competition (AMC)](https://maa.org/student-programs/amc/) for Peddie students to compete in. If you are interested, watch for emails from Mrs. Montgomery or one of the student leaders later this year. Also, make sure you are free on the following dates:
 * COMC: October 30, 2024
 * AMC 10/12 A: We are not holding this due to conflicts with Blair week
 * AMC 10/12 B: Tuesday, November 12 from 3pm to 4:30pm at Efros. [Sign up here]
